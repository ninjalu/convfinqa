    "* I focused most of my attention on llama3, and slightly tuned the prompt with based on the output I got from it.\n",
    "* Evaluation across all models was done only on the first 10 examples due to a combination of long run time (25min for smaller models) and an error from an edge case I had with Pydantic through Ragas, that I haven't had time to debug.\n",
    "* I used the same embedding model throughout nomic-embed-text for simplicity.\n",
    "* I evaluted with Ragas as well as by eye, just to have an understanding how models perform and how evaluation are done.\n",
    "* I chose to evaluate with llama3.2 for simplicity. Models could report higher metrics for responses coming from its own model (family) \n",
    "* I tried to evaluate five open source LLM models: llama3, mistral-nemo, codegemma, qwen2-math, command-r served on my local machine. I couldn't run commdand-r, not enough memory\n"

    "#### Evaluate llama3 RAG by eye and llm metrics\n",
    "Architecture and design choices:\n",
    "* I ended up using retrieval thinking I could probably increase accuracy by filtering out only relevant information (hence will appear on top by default), based on Cohere's finding that even ranking the retrieved documents according to relevancy can increase accuracy.\n",
    "* I used LLM to first fact finding in the table before integrating it with the pre and post texts.\n",
    "* I used RAGAS for evaluation, metrics includes LLMContextRecall, Faithfullness, LLMConextPrecisionReference, SemanticSimilarity. Except SemanticSimilary, the others are all LLM based, this could introduce additional uncertainty when interpreting the results, will see from the example below. I chose these metrics because I want to look at the accuracy of the result (faithfullness), and the effectiveness of context  retrieval the answer is based on(LLMContextRecal, LLMContextPrecision, SemanticSimilarity)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observations during experiment and conclusions:\n",
    "* Enforcing json output could harm results (for Lllama3). For the LLM to explain its steps and actions could help it find the right answers, especially when there are multiple steps needed.\n",
    "* Random seed affects math and reasoning more than retrieving relavent information.\n",
    "* There were some problem evaluating the results with Ragas using models that are not the same the one used for qa (?). This might need further  adjustments.\n",
    "* Faithfulness is not accurate for llama3 as evaluator.\n",
    "* When there is a llm component introduced into the chain in addition to the question answering, additional unpredictability is introduced. That demonstarted in assessing 10 examples vs 1. By chance the component extracting facts from the table was not performing as intended, it hurt the result. \n",
    "* With the limited time, the relevancy of the retrieved information is hugely important in getting the answer correct, and in this case, because of the brittleness of the table transformation, the relevant information is often not retrieved correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lessons learned (what I would do differently next time):\n",
    "* Extracting information correctly and completely can have a huge impact on result. But question answering even with the same seed and same context could vary! Adding challenges in evaluating model results.\n",
    "* There is a huge variation in different evalution from different models. Therefore, it is important to quickly find out common mistakes and collect examples of the RAG system, and find a good evaluator that agrees with humanns\n",
    "* Quickly test with different models with minimum fine tuning to select qa LLM candidates\n",
    "* Without degrading the performance, introduce the least amount of LLm component to reduce brittleness of the system\n",
    "* Use tools to do maths and logic instead of relying on the models. Or explore generating code for it's reasoning calculation step, for accuracy.\n",
