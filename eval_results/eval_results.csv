**Step 1: List facts from the context that can help us find out the answer**

From the text, I extract the following facts:

* The investment was made in UPS (United Parcel Service) in 2004.
* The investment was sold in 2006.

No additional financial information is provided in the text. However, we can assume that some financial data might be available elsewhere or in a separate table.

**Step 2: Reasoning or calculation**

To calculate the ROI (Return on Investment), we need to know the initial investment amount and the final value of the investment after selling it in 2006. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the text.

However, I can provide some general guidance on how to calculate ROI:

ROI = (Gain from sale - Initial investment) / Initial investment

Where Gain from sale is the difference between the selling price and the initial purchase price.

Since we don't have the necessary financial data, I'll output a message indicating that no answer was found:
