To answer this, I'll need to extract some facts from the context and then perform a calculation.

**Step 1: List facts from the context**

* The total cumulative return on investment is calculated as the change in quarterly stock price plus reinvested dividends.
* The comparison assumes an initial investment of $100 on December 31, 2004.
* The time period under consideration is five years, ending December 31, 2009.

**Step 2: Reasoning or calculation**

To find the difference in percentage cumulative return on investment for United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) compared to the S&P 500 index, I'll need to calculate the cumulative returns for both UPS and the S&P 500 index over the five-year period.

Let's assume that the quarterly stock prices and reinvested dividends are available for both UPS and the S&P 500 index. We can then calculate the total cumulative return on investment for each using the formula:

Total Cumulative Return = (Ending Value - Beginning Value) / Beginning Value

where Ending Value is the value of the investment at the end of the five-year period, and Beginning Value is the initial investment of $100.

Once we have calculated the total cumulative returns for both UPS and the S&P 500 index, we can find the difference in percentage cumulative return on investment by subtracting the S&P 500 index's return from UPS' return:

Difference in Percentage Cumulative Return = (UPS' Total Cumulative Return - S&P 500 Index's Total Cumulative Return) / Beginning Value

**Answer**

{""answer"": <calculated value>, ""contexts"": [""The total cumulative return on investment is calculated as the change in quarterly stock price plus reinvested dividends."", ""The comparison assumes an initial investment of $100 on December 31, 2004."", ""The time period under consideration is five years, ending December 31, 2009.""]}

Please note that I don't have the actual values for UPS' and S&P 500 index's quarterly stock prices and reinvested dividends. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer. However, this should give you an idea of how to approach the problem.",-26.16%,,,0.0,0.30656050056038003
